# james's test Kotlin project

This is used to validate Kotlin deployments

## Running the application locally

The application comes with a `dev` spring profile that includes default settings for running locally. This is not
necessary when deploying to kubernetes as these values are included in the helm configuration templates -
e.g. `values-dev.yaml`.

There is also a `docker-compose.yml` that can be used to run a local instance of the template in docker and also an
instance of HMPPS Auth (required if your service calls out to other services using a token).

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up
```

will run the application and HMPPS Auth within a local docker instance.

### Running the application in Intellij

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up --scale james-kotlin-test=0
```

will just start a docker instance of HMPPS Auth. The application should then be started with a `dev` active profile
in Intellij.

### Building and running the docker image locally

The `Dockerfile` relies on the application being built first. Steps to build the docker image:
1. Build the jar files
```
./gradlew clean assemble
```
2. Copy the jar files to the base directory so that the docker build can find them
```
cp build/libs/*.jar .
```
3. Build the docker image with required arguments
```
docker build --build-arg GIT_REF=21345 --build-arg GIT_BRANCH=bob --build-arg BUILD_NUMBER=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d') .
```
4. Run the docker image, setting the auth url so that it starts up
```
docker run -e HMPPS_AUTH_URL="https://sign-in-dev.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/auth" <sha from step 3>
```
